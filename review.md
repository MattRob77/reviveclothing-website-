## Project Review Deliverables

1. Put a 'ADD'  on each item component in the "/shop" route

2. In your redux reducer, create a cart key with a value of an empty array, and an action that updates the redux store's state and adds the ID of the added item to that array  

3. Add logic so that if the cart has a product's ID in it, the 'ADD' button that we implemented earlier does not render (ie conditional rendering), or change the text to say ALREADY IN CART

- Review the concepts behind 'connect' and why we use it
- Understanding passing down props manually
- Try to fulfill deliverables above, asking the question "what information are you grabbing and where are you putting it"?
